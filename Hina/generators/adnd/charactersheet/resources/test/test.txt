Faithful worshippers and Clerics see themselves as protectors of the weak and helpless as a farmer who tends his crops. 
A cleric of Ilmura will never start a fight nor harm a sentient creature that isn't a threat. They strongly value 
personalities of fortitude, tolerance and indutriousness, prefering those who would rather burden a problem themselvs and 
only asking for help when they cannot complete the task themselves.

Ilmura is the diety of farms and feasts and is revered every Festag. She is described as an excepionally tall woman dressed 
in seasonal colours and foilage of timely crops. She is fair skinned with long red hair and smells of crops relevant to the 
season (fresh Kale in Spring, Peppercorn in Summer, Sweet Potato in Autmn and mustard and honey in Winter) During her 
Festival and during some Festags, especially after a bountiful crop, a celebration is held where a woman matching her 
description is found andacts as host to the feast, being placed on a 4 foot high chair. During the festival she takes 
requests for blessings from the towns people in exchange for their praise. This tradition originates from the belief that 
Ilmura makes an apperance in one village every Festag as a traveling mortal Red heads are uncommon in Rhunefaust so its not 
rare for small towns to send someone to larger cities to play the role of the goddess.
