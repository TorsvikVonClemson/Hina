This odcument outline the format that the PDF will use to draw the character sheet.
All relevent information will be loaded into an array that the PDF will use as a reference
The design of the PDF itsself will need to be experimented with over time.
Space must be reserved for the potential number of instancs i.e. 20 lines for proficiencies.
Some list memebers will have multiple variables within them. The pdf will need to know how to seperate them, because of this a character will have to be used as a part seperator. This is the instance for things like weapon statistics.

Currently the seperator will be '!'. This may be changed at any time.
